        <p>Eileen Myles came to New York from Boston in 1974 to be a poet, subsequently a novelist, public talker and art journalist. A Sagittarius, their twenty books include evolution (poems), Afterglow (a dog memoir), a 2017 re-issue of Cool for You, I Must Be Living Twice/new and selected poems, and Chelsea Girls. Eileen Myles graduated from U. Mass (Boston) in 1971. Their poetic education primarily took place at St. Mark's Poetry Project from 1975 to 1977, through attending readings and participating in workshops led by Alice Notley, Ted Berrigan, Bill Zavatsky and Paul Violi. From 1984 to 1986 Eileen was the artistic director of St. Mark's Poetry Project.
        <p>From 1977 to 1979 they published dodgems, a poetry magazine that represented a collision of New York School, Language Poetry, performance texts, unconventional prose, as well as tossed-off notes from neighbors and celebrities (Lily Tomlin.)</p>
        <p>In 1979 they worked as assistant to poet James Schuyler.</p>
        <p>In 2004, Myles wrote the libretto for the opera Hell, composed by Michael Webster. In 2010, they created and directed for the Dia Center for the Arts a performance piece, The Collection of Silence, which involved dancers, poets, children, visual artists, and Buddhists in a collective public act of silence at the Hispanic Society in New York.</p>
        <p>In 2016 Eileen Myles began showing the photos they had been posting on Instagram at the Schoolhouse Gallery in Provincetown, MA. In 2018-2019 they are showing photos at Bridget Donahue Gallery in NYC.</p>
        <p>Eileen has contributed to a wide number of publications including BookForum, and ArtForum, the Village Voice and Art in America, The New Yorker, Harpers, Parkett, The Believer, Vice, Cabinet, The New York Times, The Nation, Playboy and The Poetry Project Newsletter and New York Magazine. They've contributed essays to catalogs for individual artists such as Donald Judd, Kathy Bradford, Shannon Ebner, Marilyn Minter, Zoe Leonard and Jack Pierson. Myles has been reading and talking and presenting their work in festivals, at colleges and galleries, museums and bookstores all over North America, South America, Europe, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand since the early 1980s.</p>
