          <p>Eileen Myles (they/them) came to New York from Boston in &rsquo;74 to be a poet, subsequently novelist, public talker and art journalist. A Sagittarius, their 22 books include <em>For Now,</em> a talk/essay on writing, <em>evolution, Afterglow, I Must Be Living Twice/new and selected poems, Chelsea Girls, Cool for You</em> and <em>Inferno,</em> a poet&rsquo;s novel.</p>
          <p>They graduated from U. Mass (Boston) in 1971. Their poetic education mainly took place at St. Mark&rsquo;s Poetry Project from 1975 to 1977, attending almost every single reading for ten years and participating in workshops led by Alice Notley, Ted Berrigan, Bill Zavatsky and Paul Violi. From 1984 to 1986 Eileen was the artistic director of St. Mark&rsquo;s Poetry Project.</p>
          <p>From 1977 to 1979 they published <em>dodgems,</em> a poetry magazine that represented a collision of New York School, Language Poetry, performance texts, unconventional prose, as well as tossed-off notes from neighbors and celebrities (Lily Tomlin and David Clennon.)</p>
          <p>They worked as assistant to poet James Schuyler in 1979 while he was living in the Chelsea Hotel.</p>
          <p>In the 80s and 90s they worked on a number of collaborative and individual theater projects. <em>Joan of Arc,</em> a spiritual entertainment and <em>Patriarchy</em> (a play) were both performed (once) at St. Mark&rsquo;s Church. <em>Leaving New York,</em> a solo performance piece and <em>Feeling Blue Pts. 1, 2 & 3</em> and <em>Modern Art,</em> written and directed by Eileen Myles, were produced at PS 122. In 2004, Myles wrote the libretto for the opera <em>Hell,</em> composed by Michael Webster with productions in 2004 and 2006. In 2010, they created and directed for the Dia Center for the Arts a performance piece, <em>The Collection of Silence,</em> which involved dancers, poets, kids, visual artists, and Buddhists in a collective public act of silence at the Hispanic Society in New York.</p>
          <p>In 2016 Eileen Myles began exhibiting photos at the Schoolhouse Gallery in Provincetown and in 2018-2019 they showed their photos at Bridget Donahue Gallery in New York.</p>
          <p>In 2019 they wrote and directed <em>The Trip,</em> an 18-minute super-8 road film with puppets. Edited and produced by David Fenster. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omcdaUy6JfE" target="_blank" tabindex="1">See it on youtube</a>.</p>
          <p>Eileen has contributed writing and photos to a wide number of publications including <em>BookForum, ArtForum, Camera Austria, Cultured, Art in America, The New Yorker, Harpers, The Believer, Vice, Poetry, Dazed and Confused, The New York Times, The Nation, The New Republic, Playboy, New York Magazine</em> and <em>The Poetry Project Newsletter.</em> They&rsquo;ve been profiled and reviewed in lots of these same magazines. They&rsquo;ve written catalog essays on Kelly Reichardt, Donald Judd, Kathy Bradford, Shannon Ebner, Marilyn Minter, Zoe Leonard, Cathy Opie, Jack Pierson and many others. Moyra Davy is forthcoming. Probably most importantly they&rsquo;ve read their poems, spoken and presented their work in festivals, at colleges and galleries, museums and bookstores all over North America, South America, Europe, Iceland, Australia, Argentina and New Zealand since the early 1980s. Notably they toured nationally in a van with Sister Spit in &rsquo;97 and 2007.</p>
          <p>Eileen Myles has received a Guggenheim, a Warhol/Creative Capital Arts Writers grant, 3 Lambda Book Awards and a &ldquo;Pioneer&rdquo; lifetime achievement award, the Shelley Prize from the PSA, and an award from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts. In 2016, they received a Creative Capital grant and the Clark Prize for excellence in art writing. In 2019 they received a poetry award from the American Academy of Arts & Letters. In 2020 they got the Bill Whitehead Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Publishing Triangle. They live in New York City and Marfa, TX with their pit bull Honey.</p>
