        <h3>from <em>Not Me</em></h3>

        <p><em>HOLES</em></p>

        <p class ="line">Once when I passed East Fourth Street off First Avenue,</p>
        <p class ="line">I think it was in early fall and I had a small hole</p>
        <p class ="line">in the shoulder of my white shirt, and another on</p>
        <p class ="line">the backâ€“I looked just beautiful. There was a</p>
        <p class ="line">whole moment in the 70s when it was beautiful</p>
        <p class ="line">to have holes in your shirts and sweaters.</p>
        <p class ="line">By now it was 1981, but I carried that 70s style</p>
        <p class ="line">around like a torch. There was a whole way of</p>
        <p class ="line">feeling about yourself that was more European</p>
        <p class ="line">than American, unless it was American around</p>
        <p class ="line">1910 when it was beautiful to be a strong</p>
        <p class ="line">starving immigrant who believed so much</p>
        <p class ="line">in herself and she was part of a movement</p>
        <p class ="line">as big as history and it explained the</p>
        <p class ="line">hole in her shirt. It&rsquo;s the beginning</p>
        <p class ="line">of summer tonight, and every season has</p>
        <p class ="line">cracks through which winter</p>
        <p class ="line">or fall might leak out. The most perfect</p>
        <p class ="line">flavor of it, oddly in June. Oh remember</p>
        <p class ="line">when I was an immigrant. I took a black</p>
        <p class ="line">beauty and got up from the pile of poems</p>
        <p class ="line">around my knees and just had too much</p>
        <p class ="line">energy for thought and walked over to</p>
        <p class ="line">your house where there was continuous</p>
        <p class ="line">beer. Finally we were just drinking</p>
        <p class ="line">Rheingold, a hell of a beer. At the</p>
        <p class ="line">door I mentioned I had a crush on both</p>
        <p class ="line">of you, what you say to a couple. By</p>
        <p class ="line">now the kids were in bed. I can&rsquo;t</p>
        <p class ="line">even say clearly now that I wanted</p>
        <p class ="line">the woman, though it seemed to be</p>
        <p class ="line">the driving principle then, wanting</p>
        <p class ="line">one of everything. I was part of</p>
        <p class ="line">a generation of people who went to</p>
        <p class ="line">the bars on 7th street and drank the</p>
        <p class ="line">cheap whiskey and the ale on tap and dreamed</p>
        <p class ="line">about when I would get you alone. Those</p>
        <p class ="line">big breasts. I carried slim notebooks which only</p>
        <p class ="line">permitted two or three-word lines. I need you.</p>
        <p class ="line">&ldquo;Nearing the Horse.&rdquo; There was blood in all my</p>
        <p class ="line">titles, and milk. I had two bright blue pills</p>
        <p class ="line">in my pocket. I loved you so much. It was</p>
        <p class ="line">the last young thing I ever did, the end of</p>
        <p class ="line">my renaissance, an immigration into my</p>
        <p class ="line">dream world which even my grandparents</p>
        <p class ="line">had not dared to live, being prisoners</p>
        <p class ="line">of schizophrenia and alcohol, though</p>
        <p class ="line">I was lovers with the two. The beauty</p>
        <p class ="line">of the story is that it happened.</p>
        <p class ="line">It was the last thing that happened</p>
        <p class ="line">in New York. Everything else happened</p>
        <p class ="line">while I was stopping it from happening.</p>
        <p class ="line">Everything else had a life of</p>
        <p class ="line">its own. I don&rsquo;t think I owe</p>
        <p class ="line">them an apology, though at least</p>
        <p class ="line">one of their kids hates my guts.</p>
        <p class ="line">She can eat my guts for all</p>
        <p class ="line">I care. I had a small hole in</p>
        <p class ="line">the front of my black sleeveless</p>
        <p class ="line">sweater. It was just something</p>
        <p class ="line">that happened. It got larger</p>
        <p class ="line">and larger. I liked to put</p>
        <p class ="line">my finger in it. In the month</p>
        <p class ="line">of December I couldn&rsquo;t get</p>
        <p class ="line">out of bed. I kept waking</p>
        <p class ="line">up at 6PM and it was Christmas</p>
        <p class ="line">or New Year&rsquo;s and I had</p>
        <p class ="line">started drinking & eating. I remember</p>
        <p class ="line">you handing me the most beautiful</p>
        <p class ="line">red plate of pasta. It was like your cunt</p>
        <p class ="line">on a plate. I met people in your house</p>
        <p class ="line">even found people to go out and fuck,</p>
        <p class ="line">regrettably, not knowing about</p>
        <p class ="line">the forbidden fruit. I forget</p>
        <p class ="line">what the only sin is. Somebody</p>
        <p class ="line">told me recently. I have so</p>
        <p class ="line">many holes in my memory. Between</p>
        <p class ="line">me and the things I&rsquo;m separated</p>
        <p class ="line">from. I pick up a book and</p>
        <p class ="line">another book and memory</p>
        <p class ="line">and separation seem to</p>
       <p class ="line"> be all anyone writes</p>
        <p class ="line">about. Or all they</p>
        <p class ="line">seem to let me read.</p>
        <p class ="line">But I remember those</p>
        <p class ="line">beautiful holes on</p>
        <p class ="line">my back like a</p>
        <p class ="line">beautiful cloak</p>
        <p class ="line">of feeling.</p>
