        <h3>from <em>For Now</em></h3>
        <p>I think last year I got the beautiful bound versions Yale published of Patti Smith and Knausgaard giving this talk and I sat in a chair in my apartment and I took a look at each of them and at least as far as the beginnings both of them sounded like themselves and I thought well I certainly can do that.</p>
        <p>When I received the invitation to give this talk, I think it was the summer before last or maybe that spring I was given a date and a fee and I kind of put it at the back of my mind as something nice that would happen the following September or October and then in August I got in touch with Michael because I hadn&rsquo;t heard anything but it turns out that&rsquo;s because I had the wrong year. And I figure I can start with that.</p>
        
        <h3 class="margin-top-l"><em>from Kirkus Reviews</em></h3>
        <p><em>Personal digressions and lyrical ruminations from an award-winning writer.</em></p>
        <p><em>In the latest entry in the publisher&rsquo;s <em>Why I Write</em> series, lecturer, poet, novelist, performer, and art journalist Myles offers candid, peripatetic reflections on identity, vocation, and, not least, place. The author recounts a protracted struggle to stay in their tiny, rent-controlled apartment in Manhattan&rsquo;s East Village, home for more than 40 years, after the landlord insisted on a buyout. &ldquo;The city has taught me almost everything I know about language and existence and being a writer,&rdquo; Myles reveals. Besides p aying homage to the grit and textures of Manhattan, the author creates a palpable portrait of Marfa, Texas, where, after a brief visit, they bought a house. &ldquo;Texas felt great because it was deeply unfamiliar,&rdquo; writes the author. Around 1997, Myles began to sense &ldquo;something I think of as the archival moment, and before I sold anything I already started to feel the creeping value of the past and the new place the past was playing in the present.&rdquo; A crisis occurred when Myles lost a box destined for the archive; searching for it involved two psychics, a hypnotist, and astrologers until Myles eventually gave up. The archive — without that box — resides at Yale. Of choosing a career as a writer, the author admits that in their 20s, &ldquo;I discovered that to be real was an interior project&rdquo; that involves &ldquo;a kind of aesthetic experience I believe that precedes the work so that you kind of fail into it finding your style and content and opportunity all together at last and that&rsquo;s happened enough times for me to believe that that&rsquo;s my process.&rdquo; As for gender identity, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so obviously a lesbian,&rdquo; Myles writes, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even call myself a lesbian anymore. I say queer, or trans. I say they but none of that matters.&rdquo;</em></p>
