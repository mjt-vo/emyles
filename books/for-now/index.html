        <p>In this raucous meditation, Eileen Myles offers an intimate glimpse into creativity&rsquo;s immediacy. With erudition and wit, Myles recounts their early years as an awakening writer; existential struggles with landlords; storied moments with neighbors, friends, and lovers; and the textures and identities of cities and the country that reveal the nature of writing as presence in time.</p>
        <p>For Myles, time&rsquo;s &ldquo;optic quality&rdquo; is what enables writing in the first place—as attention, as devotion, as excess. It is this chronologized vision that enables the writer to love the world as it presently is, lending love a linguistic permanence amid social and political systems that threaten to eradicate it. Irreverent, generous, and always insightful, <em>For Now</em> is a candid record of the creative process from one of our most beloved artists.</p>
